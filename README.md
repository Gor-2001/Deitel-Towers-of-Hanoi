# Deitel Towers of Hanoi

A C++ implementation of the classic **Towers of Hanoi** puzzle, inspired by the *Deitel C++ Book*. This project uses **CMake** for building and supports **Windows** and **Linux**.

***

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple game modes** based on:
  - Number of disks.
  - Starting positions of disks.
- **Interactive gameplay** with on-screen instructions.
- **Cross-platform support**.
- Easy to extend or modify for different variations of the game.

***

## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions

Follow the on-screen prompts to select the number of disks and the starting positions. Use the keys shown during the game to control it.

## 📝 Notes

- **Tested on Windows** with Visual Studio.
- **Linux support** requires the `ncurses` library.
- Designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate C++ concepts from Deitel's book.

## 🛠️ Building the Project

The project can be built on both Windows and Linux using a standard CMake workflow.

### Windows 💻

1.  **Generate build files:** Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to generate the build files in a new directory named `out`.
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B out
    ```

2.  **Build the project:** Use CMake to build the project from the `out` directory.
    ```bash
    cmake --build out
    ```

### Linux 🐧

1.  **Install ncurses:** First, you need to install the **ncurses** library to handle console input and output. Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
    ```

2.  **Generate build files:** Generate the build files in the `out` directory:
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B out
    ```

3.  **Build the project:** Build the project using CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake --build out
    ```

## ▶️ Running the Executable

Once the project is successfully built, you can run the executable from the terminal.

### Windows 💻

The executable is located in the `out/Debug/` directory.

```bash
out\Debug\DeitelTowersOfHanoi.exe

### Linux 🐧

The executable is located directly in the out/ directory.

```bash
./out/DeitelTowersOfHanoi
